# Arch Linux Packages

## Notes
There are two versions: `vcs` and `release`. The `vcs` versions will have `-vcs` as a suffix to the name to indicate that it's built off of the latest code available. The release packages are built on a release and thus tend to be more stable. General `release` should be used but `vcs` can be used as well for latest code or for things that don't provide a release.
